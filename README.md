# Financial-numerics-Generating-a-2D-predator-prey-Model

Random time series with a length of 252 and 2520 (or more) were generated, mixed using a matrix A, and six correlated series were generated. The correlation and covariant matrices for the mixed and independent sets of the series were calculated. It was investigated whether it is possible to recreate the original set of series from the mixed one. A pandas.DataFrame was either downloaded, imported, or created and analyzed using transformations. Data from Yahoo was then downloaded, and basic statistical analysis was carried out in order to find any positive and negative correlations. The statistical mechanics of money was implemented to analyze the money distribution as a function of time. Additionally, a 2D predator-prey model, or some other agent-based model such as the one for pandemic spread, was implemented and analyzed.
